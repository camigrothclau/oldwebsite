                                    <p>At this time I was a project lead at EyeReply conducting several UX
                                        Research
                                        studies for different clients. One client of retail and supermarket business
                                        asked
                                        me and my team to test the app communication of their members app based on
                                        two different menu structures. The client’s challenge was to both meet
                                        business
                                        needs and at the same time serve a satisfying user experience through the
                                        app
                                        design. They had a couple of design ideas of which the menu structure
                                        differed
                                        from one another. We decided on two versions to test with users.</p>

                                <h2 class="txt-headline portfolio">WHAT I DID</h1>
                                    <p>I recruited 10 participants based on target group criteria I had
                                        agreed on with the
                                        client. I tested the app menu concepts by conducting an A/B approach,
                                        rotating
                                        the two versions from test to test (A-B, B-A...) in a UX lab through in
                                        depth
                                        interview, observation and mobile eye tracking to catch the visual attention
                                        and
                                        user behaviour and to see whether users would interact with different
                                        elements
                                        based on the design of menus. The eye tracking data could tell, if
                                        participants
                                        were
                                        reading relevant information. Eye tracking could also tell which elements
                                        were
                                        too
                                        hidden or tell why users would interact in a certain way or why they
                                        understood
                                        the
                                        information in certain ways. I gave the participants three tasks and
                                        observed
                                        them
                                        solving the tasks: ‘check your bonus’, ‘imagine that you should go pay for
                                        groceries with your bonus’ and ‘try to find products with discount in the
                                        app
                                        that
                                        is
                                        interesting for you’. In the end I sat down with the client team to discuss
                                        findings
                                        and actionable insights.</p>

                                    <p>During my time working as a research consultant a big client selling
                                        smoking cessation products
                                        asked me and my team to examine their position on the market in relation to
                                        one
                                        big
                                        competitor.
                                        They also wanted to know how consumers perceived their product on the shelf
                                        and
                                        how
                                        marketing initiatives such as small samples of gum, lozenges etc performed
                                        visually

                                        the desk.
                                        They further wanted to learn more about consumer product preferences in
                                        general

                                    <p>I was working with my boss and one other researcher for three weeks
                                        to plan the research
                                        methods in order to be able to provide our client with valuable insights
                                        matching
                                        their
                                        needs. We
                                        decided to examine the actual in-store purchase behaviour on location and
                                        conduct
                                        individual
                                        interviews about the purchase experience and product preferences.
                                        I was in charge of recruiting the participants and I completed the
                                        interviews
                                        and
                                        observations.
                                        All 40 participants were asked to go into the store to buy a smoking
                                        cessation
                                        product
                                        of their
                                        own choice and I observed the behaviour in 4 different stores to see
                                        differences
                                        in
                                        behaviour and
                                        patterns based on environments: where in the store would they look for the
                                        product?
                                        Did
                                        they ask
                                        the shop assistents about anything? Did they spot the marketing initiatives
                                        in
                                        the
                                        store? Did they
                                        act differently based on environments? Did they choose our clients product
                                        or
                                        the
                                        one of
                                        the
                                        competitor? I held semi-structured individual interviews right after the
                                        purchase
                                        asking
                                        why they
                                        chose the product in terms of preferences and considerations of the
                                        competitive
                                        product.
                                        Finally I
                                        interviewed the participants about their associations around the packaging.
                                        After three weeks of research I wrote a report about behaviour patterns and
                                        insights
                                        about
                                        preferences and consumer needs from our study and presented it to our client
                                        to
                                        discuss
                                        next
                                        steps with them.</p>

                                    <p>I always found it interesting to examine how
                                        products serve important purposes and needs to
                                        specific target groups. This interest led me in 2016
                                        to research the daily lives of teens with diabetes and
                                        the tools they use everyday to detect a gap of
                                        (perhaps) something missing to make their daily lives
                                        even easier. For this project I wanted to examine
                                        whether a Gamification strategy could support teens
                                        between the age of 13 and 17 with type 1 diabetes
                                        to become motivated to overcome everyday
                                        challenges related to regulating their blood glucose
                                        – particularly among friends and peers outside
                                        home.</p>

                                    <p>To examine the problem, I conducted two workshops through a
                                        participatory design approach
                                        with nine teens with diabetes type 1. The outcomes of the first workshop
                                        were
                                        analyzed
                                        to
                                        detect how diabetes-related tools support mediating diabetes-related
                                        everyday
                                        practices
                                        in
                                        relation to regulate blood glucose. The outcomes of the second workshop were
                                        as
                                        well
                                        analyzed
                                        to detect how game elements can mediate certain intended behaviors for the
                                        teens
                                        to

                                        motivated to overcome five main challenges that I found in the first
                                        workshop.
                                        Secondly,
                                        the
                                        outcomes of the second workshop were analyzed by applying a gamification

                                        to investigate the effects of game elements for diabetes practices. Through

                                    <p>The Copenhagen Municipality came to us (research consultant agency,
                                        EyeReply)
                                        as they were experiencing a lot of frustration and confusion among citizens
                                        applying for monetary benefits. Citizens have to visit a number og touch
                                        points
                                        to
                                        receive the information the need for applying correctly. They have to fill

                                        an
                                        online form to apply, but what many citizens do not know is, that they have

                                    <p>I visited three different job centers to conduct contextual research.
                                        I met up with 9
                                        social workers in different departments. My plan with this contextual
                                        research
                                        was
                                        to detect challenges in their everyday supporting citizens in applying for
                                        monetary
                                        benefits. Which challenges did they experience? What would they typically
                                        have
                                        to
                                        help citizens with and how? What information material could they provide the
                                        citizens with? I sought to answer such questions. At job centers I also
                                        interviewed
                                        9 people applying for monetary benefits in order to cover challenges from
                                        their
                                        point of view.
                                        I further did a Usability test of the online form with 9 participants
                                        strategically
                                        recruited for applying for monetary benefits. Users would often not be able
                                        to
                                        fill
                                        the form without having visited several other touch points in advance. After
                                        gathering all the research I could clearly see challenges throughout the
                                        journey.
                                        I suggested new ways of providing information to citizens before, during and
                                        after
                                        applying for monetary benefits. I further shared insights about social
                                        workers’
                                        challenges caused by not collaborating in helping citizens on their journey.
